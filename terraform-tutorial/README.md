## Introduction

OpenTofu is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision cloud infrastructure using declarative configuration files. It's a community-driven fork of Terraform that maintains compatibility with Terraform configurations.

### What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

### Benefits of OpenTofu

- **Version Control**: Infrastructure configurations are stored in version control
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent infrastructure across environments
- **Automation**: Reduces manual errors and speeds up deployments
- **Documentation**: Infrastructure is self-documenting
- **Collaboration**: Teams can work together on infrastructure changes

## Theory and Concepts

Before diving into examples, it's important to understand the core concepts:

### Core Components

1. **Providers**: Plugins that interact with APIs of cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
2. **Resources**: Infrastructure components (EC2 instances, S3 buckets, etc.)
3. **Data Sources**: Read-only information about existing infrastructure
4. **Variables**: Input parameters for your configurations
5. **Outputs**: Values returned after infrastructure creation
6. **Modules**: Reusable components that encapsulate multiple resources

### OpenTofu Workflow

1. **Write**: Create configuration files (.tf files)
2. **Initialize**: Run `tofu init` to download providers
3. **Plan**: Run `tofu plan` to preview changes
4. **Apply**: Run `tofu apply` to create/modify infrastructure
5. **Destroy**: Run `tofu destroy` to remove infrastructure

### State Management

OpenTofu maintains a state file that tracks the current state of your infrastructure. This state file is crucial for:
- Tracking resource dependencies
- Determining what changes need to be made
- Managing resource lifecycle

## Prerequisites

Before starting with the examples, ensure you have:

1. **OpenTofu installed**: Download from [OpenTofu website](https://opentofu.org/)
2. **AWS CLI configured**: With appropriate credentials
3. **AWS Account**: With necessary permissions for the resources you'll create
4. **Text Editor**: For writing configuration files

### Installing OpenTofu

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install opentofu

# Linux
wget https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/releases/latest/download/tofu_linux_amd64.zip
unzip tofu_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv tofu /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
tofu version
```

### AWS Configuration

```bash
# Configure AWS CLI
aws configure

# Or set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
```

## Examples

This tutorial includes individual examples for common AWS resources:

### 1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- **Location**: `examples/vpc/`
- **Description**: Creates a custom VPC with subnets, internet gateway, and route tables
- **Key Concepts**: Networking basics, CIDR blocks, subnets

### 2. EC2 Instance
- **Location**: `examples/ec2/`
- **Description**: Launches an EC2 instance with security groups
- **Key Concepts**: Compute resources, security groups, key pairs

### 3. S3 Bucket
- **Location**: `examples/s3/`
- **Description**: Creates an S3 bucket with versioning and encryption
- **Key Concepts**: Object storage, bucket policies, versioning

### 4. RDS Database
- **Location**: `examples/rds/`
- **Description**: Sets up an RDS PostgreSQL database instance
- **Key Concepts**: Managed databases, parameter groups, security

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to an example directory**:
   ```bash
   cd examples/vpc
   ```

2. **Initialize OpenTofu**:
   ```bash
   tofu init
   ```

3. **Review the configuration**:
   ```bash
   tofu plan
   ```

4. **Apply the configuration**:
   ```bash
   tofu apply
   ```

5. **Clean up when done**:
   ```bash
   tofu destroy
   ```

## Important Notes

- **Cost Awareness**: These examples create real AWS resources that may incur costs
- **Region Selection**: All examples use `us-west-2` by default - change as needed
- **Security**: Examples use basic security configurations - enhance for production
- **Naming**: Use unique names to avoid conflicts with existing resources

## Next Steps

After completing these individual examples, consider:

1. **Combining Resources**: Create modules that combine multiple resources
2. **Environment Management**: Use workspaces or separate directories for dev/staging/prod
3. **Remote State**: Store state files in S3 or other remote backends
4. **Advanced Features**: Explore data sources, locals, and complex expressions
