# Docker Introduction

## What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. These containers can run consistently across different environments.

## Key Concepts

### Container vs Virtual Machine
- **Virtual Machine**: Runs a complete operating system on top of a host OS
- **Container**: Shares the host OS kernel and runs in isolated user spaces

### Benefits of Docker
1. **Consistency**: Same environment across development, testing, and production
2. **Portability**: Run anywhere Docker is installed
3. **Efficiency**: Lightweight compared to VMs
4. **Scalability**: Easy to scale applications
5. **Isolation**: Applications run in isolated environments

## Docker Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Docker Engine**: The runtime that manages containers
2. **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers
3. **Docker Containers**: Running instances of Docker images
4. **Docker Registry**: Repository for storing Docker images (Docker Hub, private registries)

### Docker Daemon
- Background service that manages Docker objects
- Handles container lifecycle
- Manages images, networks, and volumes

## Docker vs Traditional Deployment

### Traditional Deployment
```
Application Code
├── Runtime Environment
├── System Libraries
├── Operating System
└── Hardware
```

### Docker Deployment
```
Application Code
├── Runtime Environment
├── System Libraries
└── Docker Engine
    └── Operating System
        └── Hardware
```

## Use Cases

1. **Microservices**: Deploy and scale individual services
2. **CI/CD**: Consistent build and deployment pipelines
3. **Development**: Isolated development environments
4. **Testing**: Reproducible test environments
5. **Cloud Migration**: Easy migration between cloud providers

## Getting Started

### Installation
- Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac
- Docker Engine for Linux
- Docker Compose for multi-container applications

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Check Docker version
docker --version

# Run a container
docker run hello-world

# List running containers
docker ps

# List all containers
docker ps -a

# List images
docker images
```

## Next Steps
- Learn about Docker images and containers
- Understand Dockerfile creation
- Explore Docker Compose for multi-container applications
- Practice with real-world examples
