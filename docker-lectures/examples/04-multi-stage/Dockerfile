# Multi-stage Dockerfile for Node.js Application
# This demonstrates how to use multi-stage builds for optimization

# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM node:16-alpine AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy source code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production image
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom nginx configuration
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1

# Nginx runs automatically
